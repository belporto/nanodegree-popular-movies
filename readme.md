# nanodegree-popular-movies

This is the Popular Movies project from Android Developer Nanodegree Program.

To run this project it's necessary to add a new file `keys.xml` into the `values` folder.
This file should contain the key "movie_db_api_key"

```
<resources>
  <string name="movie_db_api_key"><your api key></string>
</resources>
```

You can get your API key here: https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en
